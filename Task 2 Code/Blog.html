        <p>Last April, we had a Bless cream event for a month,
        and the response was so good.
        <p>So this time, I discussed with my mom to upgrade to my favorite menu (BPC) and proceed the event!</p>
        <p>Please check the video for how to participate in the event!</p>
        <p>Thank you so much for watching mine as always</p>
